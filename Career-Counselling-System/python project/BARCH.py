Fact = """Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch) is an undergraduate degree program in the field of architecture, typically five years long. The course covers a range of subjects such as design, construction technology, building structures, architectural history, environmental studies, and professional practice. B.Arch graduates have a wide range of career options in various industries such as architectural firms, construction companies, government agencies, and academia. Many B.Arch graduates also pursue postgraduate degrees such as Master of Architecture (M.Arch) or specialized master's degrees in architecture. To be eligible for a B.Arch program, candidates typically must have completed their secondary education or equivalent with a minimum score set by the institution. Admissions are usually granted based on entrance exams, academic scores, and personal interviews. Some institutions may also require a portfolio of the candidate's work."""
