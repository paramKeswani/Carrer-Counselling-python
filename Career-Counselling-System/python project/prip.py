Fact = """ A private secretary may be defined as an indi­vidual who is appointed by a very busy and important person to assist him in the discharge of his daily personal and confidential duties.

An important and busy man cannot and should not waste his valuable and scarce time for doing routine types of jobs.

Persons of eminence such as industrialists, politicians, directors of a com­pany, doctors, lawyers, important authors, film stars appoint private secretaries to assist them in their personal and confidential matters.

When a private secretary is appointed by an individual, the terms and conditions of his appoint­ment are determined by his master.

When a pri­vate secretary is appointed by an organisation as its Chief Executive, the terms and conditions of his appointment are determined by the rules and regu­lations of the organisation concerned.."""
